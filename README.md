🏠 Real Estate - House Prices Prediction
This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to predict real estate prices in Bangalore based on structured property data. The goal is to build an accurate and interpretable regression model, with complete data preprocessing, feature engineering, model tuning, and deployment readiness.

📌 Project Overview
Objective:
Develop a robust regression model to predict housing prices in Bangalore using input features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

Highlights:

📊 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and converted textual inputs into usable formats.

🛠️ Feature Engineering – Extracted and created new meaningful variables (e.g., price per sqft), grouped low-frequency locations, and converted categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding.

🔎 Outlier Detection – Identified and removed extreme values using domain knowledge and statistical thresholds.

🧠 Model Building – Trained and evaluated models like Linear Regression, Lasso, and Decision Trees.

📈 Performance Evaluation – Used RMSE, cross-validation, and visual diagnostics for model comparison.

💾 Model Exporting – Saved final model using joblib for API/web integration.

🔧 Tools & Technologies
Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Platform: Jupyter Notebook

ML Techniques: Regression, Feature Engineering, One-Hot Encoding, Model Validation

📁 Dataset
The dataset contains Bangalore property listings with features like location, area in square feet, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and total price.

🚀 Results
Achieved low RMSE using a simplified linear model with regularization.

Reduced feature dimensionality through location encoding and domain-based filtering.

Ready-to-integrate model for a house pricing prediction API or web app.
